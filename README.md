# Unix Typeracer Bot
A simple typeracer bot for linux (and possibly mac), written in shell
## General Notes
* Works with firefox only but adding support for other browsers should be rather easy
* Tested on linux but might work on mac as well
## Basic Usage
* open a terminal emulator
* clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/xypwn/unix-typeracer-bot.git`
* cange directory into the new folder `cd unix-typeracer-bot`
* open firefox and visit [typeracer.com](https://play.typeracer.com)
* make sure to have the typeracer tab selected, then execute the script with `sh bot.sh`
  ** if you want, you can type `sh bot.sh --help` to get some configuration options
* press Enter **after you have joined the race**
* press Enter again **after the race has started**
## Troubleshooting
* try `sh bot.sh --help` to get all possible command-line options (and possibly tweak them if it doesn't work properly)
